I'm Muhammad Usman (aka z0v3r1n), 16 year old high school student with plans to go to college one day!

I'm a beginner in low-level binary exploitation, currently getting started with vulnerability research by recreating n-day bugs with aspiration to transition to doing vulnerability research as a full-time job after college.
